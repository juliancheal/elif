= Read Me

by James Edward Gray II

== Description

Welcome to Elif.

This library is an enhanced version of my solution to Ruby Quiz #64.  The code is a port File::ReadBackwards, the Perl module by Uri Guttman, but the interface has been updated to feel like Ruby.

Elif works like a File object used in line by line reading.  The only difference is that the lines will come in reverse order.  This can be useful in parsing log files, where the interesting information is usually at the end of the file.

== Documentation

See Elif for documentation.

== Installing

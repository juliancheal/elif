= Installing Elif

RubyGems is the preferred easy install method for Elif.  However, you can 
install Elif manually as described below.

== Installing the Gem

Elif is intended to be installed via the 
RubyGems[http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/] system.  To get the latest
version, simply enter the following into your command prompt:

	$ sudo gem install elif

You must have RubyGems[http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubygems/] installed for
the above to work.

== Installing Manually

Download the latest version of Elif from the
{RubyForge project page}[http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=2684].  Navigate to
the root project directory and enter:

	$ sudo ruby setup.rb

== Running the Tests

If you would like to run Elif's test suite on your system before installing and
you have Rake installed, just issue the following command from the root of
the project directory:

  $ rake

If you do not have rake, use the following command instead:

  $ ruby -I lib:test test/ts_all.rb
